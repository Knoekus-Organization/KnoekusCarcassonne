# Knoekus Carcassonne
Digital version of the German board game Carcassonne.

Cool that you have downloaded Knoekus Carcassonne, my digital implementation of the German board game Carcassonne.

----Installing----
The game is made in MATLAB R2021b. Therefore, if you don't own this version of MATLAB or a later one, you will have to install MATLAB Runtime.
To do this, run the .exe file in the "for_redistribution" folder. This will download the correct MATLAB Runtime version from the internet. Alternatively, you can download it from the following website:

If you have previously installed a version of Knoekus Carcassonne, please install the version in the "for_redistribution_files_only" folder so you don't download the MATLAB Runtime again.
