# Knoekus Carcassonne
Digital version of the German board game Carcassonne.

Cool that you have downloaded Knoekus Carcassonne, my digital implementation of the German board game Carcassonne. If you enjoy it, it would be awesome if you supported me by [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/knoekus)! :)

## Installing
The game is made in MATLAB R2021b. Therefore, if you don't own this version of MATLAB or a later one, you will have to install MATLAB Runtime.
To do this, run the .exe file in the "for_redistribution" folder. This will download the correct MATLAB Runtime version from the internet. Alternatively, you can download it from the [Mathworks website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html).
If you have previously installed a version of Knoekus Carcassonne, please install the version in the "for_redistribution_files_only" folder so you don't download the MATLAB Runtime again.

## Wiki
The game has a built in How To Play section, but the Wiki in this repo will be updated, too. For a full overview of all rules (including all expansions) can be found on the [Wikicarpedia website](https://wikicarpedia.com/index.php/Main_Page).
